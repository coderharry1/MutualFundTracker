A **financial planning and investment management app** built to empower Indian mutual fund investors with clarity, control, and confidence.

## 🌟 Why This Project? (The Story)

Growing up in India, I often saw friends and family struggle with fragmented tools to track mutual funds. Excel sheets, scattered apps, and manual calculations made it hard to answer simple questions like:  

- *“Am I on track for my retirement?”*  
- *“What will my SIP actually be worth in real terms after inflation?”*  
- *“Which funds fit my risk tolerance?”*  

This app was born out of that pain point. My goal: **bridge the gap between complex finance and everyday users** by creating a **human-friendly, problem-solving platform** that non-IT investors can actually use.
